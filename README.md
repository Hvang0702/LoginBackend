# LoginBackend

## Description
This repository contains the code that I used for the login page for my Pixel Adventure Jump game in Unity. 

* For the front-end I used Unity and C# to construct my game.
* For the back-end I used express framework, node js, mongoDB, and Argon2.

## Technologies Used
* Express: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building server-side applications and APIs.
* Node.js: A Javascript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side.
* MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data.
* Argon2: A password hashing algorithm used to securely store user passwords.

## Features
* User registration and login functionality.
* Password hashing using Argon2 algorithm to enhance security.
* Integration with MongoDB to store user information securely on a server.
